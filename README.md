### `Technology I was using:`

- React
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, Router, React Icon, useNavigate, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS
- Rechart
- FakeData JSON

### `Highlight of This Project:`

- At first I create all the components.
- Then I create the UI
- Then I create a FakeData.JSON
- Then make a Utilize folder and make a custom hook to avoid repeat the same code.
- At the end I fetch the FakeData and complete this project.
